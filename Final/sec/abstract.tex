The principal aim of this project was to create a gaming program utilizing an Object-Oriented Programming language, C++. Within the scope of this project, we crafted a 2D game centered around arrow-based combat using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) to handle the graphical user interface. The underlying objective of developing this game also encompassed the insights into the world of game development.\\\\
Baal Arjun stands as a 2D, single-player computerized game. This game constitutes a simple two-dimensional rendition of a battlefield, presented from a top-down perspective. In this scenario, the player assumes the role of the character 'Arjuna' and engages in shooting arrows at adversaries and their cohorts. The initial three levels have been designed to function as a means of familiarizing the player with the game interface. Successful completion of each level hinges upon the player's ability to triumph over the adversaries prior to succumbing to their own defeat. Should the player emerge successful in this endeavor, they attain victory; conversely, failure to do so results in defeat.\\\\

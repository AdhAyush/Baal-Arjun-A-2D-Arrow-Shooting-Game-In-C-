\section{INTRODUCTION}
Baal Arjun is a 2D arrow shooting game that takes inspiration from the esteemed character Arjuna in the epic Mahabharata, who is widely regarded as the preeminent archer of that era. This game, known as "Baal Arjun," offers an engaging single-player experience, consisting of three chapters, each comprising numerous levels.\\\\
Within each level, the player navigates the screen and utilizes both the mouse and keyboard to precisely adjust the angle of the character named 'Arjun' in order to strike the target. The angle and position of the character can be modified until the left mouse button is clicked. Once the left button is released, the arrow swiftly propels toward the designated target coordinate. Initially, the player is allotted a limited number of arrows and possesses a finite life. With each successful hit on the target, the player's score increases. If the target is missed, the player continues playing the same level until all arrows are depleted. To successfully pass a level, all targets must be accurately hit within the designated time frame, subsequently unlocking the next level.\\\\
In the initial stages, the targets remain stationary, gradually transitioning into a non-stationary state as the levels progress, thus adding an element of challenge and dynamism to the gameplay.
